# lp-logs
john's first app from fall 2014.


This app creates logs in the form of an html table that can be copied and pasted into the excel spreadsheet that was used for keeping records in a retail loss-prevention department. This app was for learning purposes and was never deployed.

This app was developed on a company windows machine without administrative access, so using git or git-bash was not an option.  I will commit all the versions I have to see how the changes will look.
